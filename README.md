# US 006, Tables
*To create a table we do like this: *
```
| Header       | Header        | Header        |
|:---          |:----------:   | ----------:   |
|Stuff aligned | Stuff aligned | Stuff aligned |
|to the left   | in center     | to the right  |
```
and this is the result:

| Header       | Header        | Header        |
| :----        | :--------:    | -----:        |
|Stuff aligned | Stuff aligned | Stuff aligned |
